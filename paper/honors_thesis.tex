\section{Introduction}

Mental health issues are a growing societal and public health concern
in the United States.
There are a myriad of potential causes for the prevalence mental health
of mental health issues in the United States.
One plausible reason for mental health issues arising
on an individual or group level
is financial stress.

\section{Data Sources}

We obtained data from nationally representative sources
in the United States:
the American Community Survey (ACS),
the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH).

The United States Census Bureau
conducts a yearly American Community Survey
to determine how to allocate federal
funding~\cite{acs_description}.
ACS estimates are obtained by
sending surveys to households
``randomly selected through a process of scientific sampling''
aimed at representing other similar households~\cite{acs_sampling}.


All ACS estimates were obtained from
the ACS 5-Year Estimates from the year 2018.

SAMHSA is an agency within
the U.S Department of Health and Human services which
``aims to reduce the impact of substance abuse and mental
illness on America's communities''~\cite{samhsa_about_us}.
SAMHSA conducts
the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH),
which provides
``prevalence estimates for 15 measures of substance use and mental illness''
\cite{samhsa_data}.

The NSDUH estimates used in this paper are the
2016-2018 NSDUH Substate Region Estimates,
NSDUH data is collected via a multistage area probability sample,
in which regions are divided
into progressively smaller geographic units,
and interviews conducted with individuals at the smallest unit.
These interviews are aggregated to produce the NSDUH
estimates~\cite{nsduh_description}.

NSDUH provides definitions for substate regions in terms of
counties and census tracts for each collection term.
The 2016-2018 substate region definitions were
pragmatically identical to the 2014-2016 substate region definitions,
and the 2014-2016 provided substate region definitions in a
usable data format, so the 2014-2016 substate region definitions
were used~\cite{samhsa_substate_region_defs}.

The main three response variables originated from the
SAMHSA data, while ACS provided demographic data used as controlling variables.

\subsection{Variables}\label{sec:finalvars}

The main response variables were chosen to measure mental health
symptoms that could have a relationship to environmental factors.
General mental illness, for instance, can be related to genetic factors
even more strongly than our predictor(s) of interest. The
mental-health-related variables chosen were: the proportion of individuals 12
or older who reported experiencing a major depressive episode in the
past year, the proportion of individuals 12 or older who reported
experiencing suicidal thoughts in the past year, and the proportion of
individuals 12 or older who reported an alcohol use disorder in the past
year. Each of these variables could intuitively have a relationship with
environmental variables, notably income, rather than genetic factors.

The main predictor variable, the (population weighted average of) the
proportion of individuals (FIXME) below the poverty level, was chosen
because we are attempting to discern the relationship between financial
stress and mental health. The proportion of individuals below the
poverty level encodes information about the lower tail of the
distribution of incomes, not simply the center of the distribution.
If a given region has more people living below the poverty line, we
would expect that to give us more information about financial stress
than simply a measure of centrality.

In addition, all variables are relative to time period.
See Section~\ref{sec:variables} for details.

A secondary question is whether the (population-weighted average of)
median income of a region does give us more information about mental
health outcomes, even given the proportion of individuals below the
poverty level. It is still feasible that a measure of center does encode
relevant information about financial stress, or is still related to
mental health outcomes. Median income was included rather than mean
income because mean income is sensitive to larger outliers, meaning in a
region where a proportion of the population is very wealthy, mean income
does not carry as much information about the income of a middle-income person
living in the region.

The model also included several demographic variables to control for
variability.

The proportion of population of Caucasian and African
American descent were chosen to control for potential socio-economic
effects on mental health outcomes. Other ethnicities were omitted to
ensure that no multicollinearity (FIXME) occured, given that knowing
multiple demographic variables gives information about what values other
proportions may be.

Median age was included as a controlling variable
both because median age could be related to mental health effects (in
that a region with a younger average population may experience more
reported or actual mental health problems in general) or income effects.

Education was accounted for by including the proportion of the
population in a region with a high school diploma or above. This
variable was included primarily to control for effects on income, given
that greater educational achievement is correlated with greater income.

Finally, the proportion of the population 15 years or older that is
married was included, to control for socioeconomic effects arising from
a greater marriage rate. For instance, reported household income is
likely higher in areas where more households consist of married
individuals (FIXME).

Note that in all of the below descriptions, the variables are described in their
non-aggregated state. A full description of the census-level variables would
include a caveat that the ACS variables are actually weighted averages of
county-level estimates. For more information on variable aggregation, see
Section~\ref{sec:aggregation}. Treat references to, for instance, the
median income, as references to the population-weighted average of
median income across a given substate region.


For a full description of variables, including data sources, see
Appendix, Section \ref{sec:variables}.

\subsection{Data Joining}\label{sec:joining}

The dataset was formed with substate regions corresponding to
``substate/aggregate region-level estimates included in the [SAMHSA] maps"
\cite{samhsa_data}. All substate regions appearing in datasets with the response
variables of interest were used as individual data points in the final dataset.
However, the final dataset also included ACS county-level estimates. As such,
the SAMHSA estimates were duplicated for every county belonging to the region,
and then aggregated back to substate-region estimates (see Section
\ref{sec:aggregation}).

\subsection{Data Aggregation}\label{sec:aggregation}

All variables in the model dataset were aggregated to the substate region level,
as defined by the SAMHSA data \cite{samhsa_substate_region_defs}.
The ACS estimates were only available at the county level,
while the response variables were only available at the substate region level.
Hence, while the preprocessed and joined data was
initially represented at the county level,
with repeated observations for the SAMHSA estimates
the final models were constructed at the substate region level.
That is, the final models were fit using data at the original
scale provided by the SAMHSA estimates, before the joining described in
Section~\ref{sec:joining}.
The ACS estimates were collapsed to the substate region level
by a population weighted average for the substate region in question.
Each numeric variable was grouped by substate region
in the following way:
Assume group $g$ contains dataset indices $I_g$,
each of which is associated with a county-level population
$p_{i}, i \in I_g$.
Then given a set of observations $x_{i}, i \in I_g$
from a numeric variable,
the condensed estimate $x_g$ would be as follows:

\begin{equation*}
    x_g = \sum_{i \in I_g}
    \left[ \frac{p_{i}}{\sum_{k \in I_g} p_{k}} x_i \right]
\end{equation*}

Note that because of the joining procedure,
we want the SAMHSA variables measured at the substate regional level,
that is, the level to which we are aggregating,
to remain the same as before the joining procedure.
We can see that the above approach accomplishes this.
If all $x_i, i \in I_g$ are equal to $\xi$,
then our procedure reduces to the following:

\begin{equation*}
    x_g =
    \sum_{i \in I_g}
    \left[ \frac{p_{i}}{\sum_{k \in I_g} p_{k}} x_i \right] =
    \sum_{i \in I_g}
    \left[ \frac{p_{i}}{\sum_{k \in I_g} p_{k}} \xi \right] =
    \left[ \frac{\sum_{i \in I_g}p_{i}}{\sum_{k \in I_g} p_{k}} \right] \xi =
    \xi
\end{equation*}

This type of aggregation thus has an asymmetrical (albeit desirable)
effect on the variables from different sources.
It leaves the substate-region-level SAMHSA estimates unchanged,
while providing substate-region-level ACS aggregated estimates
that reflect the weight of relative population within a given substate region.

After the county-level population estimates were used
to create a weighted average for the numeric variables,
they were dropped from the final dataset.
That is, population was not used as a predictor or response variable.
Only the variables mentioned in \ref{sec:finalvars}
were included in the final model.

\section{Descriptive Statistics}

As seen in Table~\ref{tab:variables},
most variables in the dataset were proportions restricted to $[0, 1]$.
However, many of the proportion variables took values on a much cmaller range.
Proportion of individuals experiencing a major depressive episode
(\texttt{prop\_MDE}),
for instance, achieved a maximum of 0.102.
The other two SAMHSA NSDUH variables achieved maxima under 0.2.
As a result, these variables had very low standard deviation.
The proportion of individuals under the poverty line was similarly
restricted to a narrower range.
Median age had very low deviation compared to the mean value.

The distributional characteristics of the proportion of African Americans
in a region showed significant skew.
Although the median proportion of African Americans in a region was 0.06,
the maximum was 0.63, and the mean was 0.111.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Primary Model Group}

The primary models used were linear regression models with the three SAMHSA
variables as response variables, and
(the population-weighted average of)
proportion of individuals below the poverty line as a primary predictor.
The other demographic variables were included as control variables,
and
(the population-weighted average of)
median household income was not included.

These three models were treated as the primary test
of a significant relationship,
and as such were the only models to which a Bonferroni-Holm
$p$-value adjustment was performed \cite{holm}.
For tests, interest was in the relationship between
(the population-weighted average of)
proportion of individuals below the poverty line
and each of the three SAMHSA variables.
The other controlling variables were not
observed for significance,
and thus not considered in the testing adjustment.


\subsection{Median Income Model Group}

The second group of three linear regression models included all variables
from the primary model,
and
(the population-weighted average of)
median household income.
These three models were fit to ascertain whether
the relationship between the
(the population-weighted average of)
proportion of individuals below the poverty line
and the SAMHSA variables was altered in the
with the inclusion of a measure of center for income.

\subsection{State Indicator Model Group}

The third group of three linear regression models included all variables
from the primary model,
and and indicator for US state for each the
substate regions defined in the SAMHSA data.
State membership was a variable of interest for two
reasons:
First, the visualizations of the predictor and response variables
showed that if there was evidence of spatial variation,
that spatial variation was strongest within state boundaries
(see Figures
\ref{fig:map-poverty},
\ref{fig:map-MDE},
\ref{fig:map-suicidal-thoughts},
\ref{fig:map-alcohol-use}
).
Second, although there did not seem to be string spatial
clustering in the fitted values of the primary model group,
it was still of interest whether adding a spatial component to
the primary model would alter any relationship between
the predictor and response for each model.
Adding an indicator for state helped accomplish both goals.
Furthermore, adding an indicator for state was much less
time-intensive than attempting to form a precise spatial model
that captured all the specially-defined SAMHSA substate regions.

\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Response Variable Correlations}

The correlation between the proportion of people who reported experiencing
a major depressive episode and
who reported experiencing suicidal thoughts was
0.765.
This is intuitive; we would expect depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts
to be positively correlated.
Furthermore, this correlation is fairly strong.

The correlation between the proportion of people who reported experiencing
a major depressive episode and
who reported experiencing an alcohol use disorder was
0.224.
This correlation is positive, but significantly weaker than
the previous correlation.
The correlation between the proportion of people who reported experiencing
suicidal thoughts and
who reported experiencing an alcohol use disorder was
0.162.
Again, this correlation is positive, but still weaker than
both the previous correlations.

The results from these correlations show that the proportion individuals
experiencing MDE and suicidal thoughts are much more strongly related to each
other than either of them are to the proportion of people experiencing
an alcohol use disorder.
Of the three responses, the proportion of people experiencing an
alcohol use disorder is the least specific.


\section{Discussion}

% It should also be noted that because data is aggregated to regional levels, we
% cannot infer a relationship between financial variables and mental health
% variables on an individual level, but rather on a regional level. We may be
% able to say that, for instance, a difference of $x$ in the average proportion
% of individuals living below poverty in a region is correlated to a difference
% of $y$ in the average proportion of individuals experiencing a major depressive
% episode. We may \textbf{not} say, given our data, that a difference of $x$ in
% an individual's average income is correlated to a difference of $y$ in the
% average of an individual's probability of experiencing a major depressive
% episode.

If it were discovered that financial hardship and mental
health issues covary, it would perhaps inform
either mental health policy, economic policy, or both.
Although the standard statistical methods used in this paper
cannot be used to draw causal conclusions with observational data,
perhaps insight into whether there is evidence that there
is a linear relationship between poverty and negative mental health effects
could be used to guide more sophisticated future research.

Note that given the unavailability of individual-level data,
and the implausibility of conducting randomized trials with our chosen responses,
some compromises were made in the research questions explored in this paper.
Data for our responses and predictors was only available on a regional level,
hence any inferential conclusions drawn
concern geographic regions, not individuals.
Furthermore, any inferential conclusions drawn will concern correlative
relationships.
Data about prevalence of mental health issues and poverty is observational
in nature, and thus modeling these phenomena does not license causal
conclusions.


\section{Appendix}

All data cleaning and joining was done with the \texttt{Pandas} Python 3 package
\cite{python_pandas}, as well as the package \texttt{python-us}~\cite{python_us}.
Of course, this required the use of Python 3 programming language
\cite{python_lang}.

All model creation was done using the \texttt{R} programming
language, version 3.6.3~\cite{r_lang}.
All data aggregation and visualization was done with the
\texttt{tidyverse} package in \texttt{R}~\cite{r_tidyverse}.

              \item[Description] Proportion of adults aged 18 or older major
                    who have had a major depressive episode in the past year
              \item[Reason for inclusion] This is a candidate for a response
                    variable. Having a major depressive episode(s) is more
                    closely linked to life events than general mental illness, in
                    which there is a lot of variation.

                    with an alcohol use disorder in the past year \\
              \item[Reason for inclusion] This is a potential response variable
                    to measure overall mental health in a population. Suicidal
                    thoughts in particular seem to be more closely linked to life
                    circumstances than genetic factors, as opposed to general
                    mental illness.

              \item[Description] The median household income for the geographic area, in US dollars.
              \item[Reason for inclusion] This is a candidate for a predictor
                    variable. Median income is a better measure than mean for the
                    distribution of income when we care about the income of a
                    standard person living in an area, rather than a measure of
                    economic productivity.
