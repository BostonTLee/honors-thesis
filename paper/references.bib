 abstract = {This paper presents a simple and widely applicable multiple test procedure of the sequentially rejective type, i.e. hypotheses are rejected one at a time until no further rejections can be done. It is shown that the test has a prescribed level of significance protection against error of the first kind for any combination of true hypotheses. The power properties of the test and a number of possible applications are also discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract: The links between poverty and health have been investigated in a number of independent studies, as well as by the Poverty Commission in the 1970s and, more recently, the National Health Strategy. However, much of the poverty research suffers from the lack of detailed information on health status, while the work conducted in the public health sphere has used rather rudimentary poverty measures. The research reported here attempts to overcome these limitations by using unit record data from two national household surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 1990. Together, these two data sets contain an enormous amount of detailed information on household incomes and the health status of individuals. Data from the two surveys are combined in a way which allows the links between poverty and health to be explored in greater detail than has hitherto been possible in Australia. Analysis of the integrated data set focuses on the links between poverty and several measures of stress-related poor health. The results from a variety of different methods point to the existence of significant differences between the reported incidence of stress of those whose incomes place them either side of a poverty threshold. The size of the statistical association between poverty and stress is of both numerical and statistical significance, although further work, preferably using longitudinal data, is needed on the important issues of causation.

@article{lund_2011,
abstract = {Summary Growing international evidence shows that mental ill health and poverty interact in a negative cycle in low-income and middle-income countries. However, little is known about the interventions that are needed to break this cycle. We undertook two systematic reviews to assess the effect of financial poverty alleviation interventions on mental, neurological, and substance misuse disorders and the effect of mental health interventions on individual and family or carer economic status in countries with low and middle incomes. We found that the mental health effect of poverty alleviation interventions was inconclusive, although some conditional cash transfer and asset promotion programmes had mental health benefits. By contrast, mental health interventions were associated with improved economic outcomes in all studies, although the difference was not statistically significant in every study. We recommend several areas for future research, including undertaking of high-quality intervention studies in low-income and middle-income countries, assessment of the macroeconomic consequences of scaling up of mental health care, and assessment of the effect of redistribution and market failures in mental health. This study supports the call to scale up mental health care, not only as a public health and human rights priority, but also as a development priority.},
